# 20K-BXL-results-scraping
Scraping script for the results of 2024's 20K of Brussels.


Disclaimer: websites' structures change rather frequently so you might have to adapt the script to the new website.
To run this you will need:
- Selenium installed
- Firefox's driver for your OS (you may also use another driver e.g. Safari but this will require code changes)
Cheers,
